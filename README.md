# NNMaker is a project devised to create simple feed foward deep neural networks that are completely customizable
---

NNMaker is program capable of reading a data set and then creating(and training) a parameterized deep neural networks. 
Fully done in C++ it trains the network using back propagation and supports discrete collumns using binarization.
